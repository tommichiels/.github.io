<p>I do hereby affirm my loyalty to the profession I am about to enter.</p>

<p>I will be mindful always of my great responsibility to preserve the privacy of my subjects, to retain their confidence and respect both as a data scientist and a friend who will guard their secrets with scrupulous honor and fidelity, to perform faithfully my professional duties, to employ only those recognized methods of investigation consistent with good judgment and with my skill and ability, keeping in mind always government laws on privacy and the subjects's capacity to recover if information is misused .</p>

<p>I will be ever vigilant in aiding in the general welfare of the community, sustaining its laws and institutions, not engaging in those practices which will in any way bring shame or discredit upon myself, my profession or my subject. I will not share information with any person or enterprise that has no legal claim on the information, though it be asked of me by others.</p>

<p>I will endeavor to work in accord with my colleagues in a spirit of progressive cooperation and never by word or by act cast imputations upon them or their rightful practices.</p>

<p>I will look with respect and esteem upon all those who have taught me my art. To my college I will be loyal and strive always for its best interests and for the interests of the students who will come after me.</p>
